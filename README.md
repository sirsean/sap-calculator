# SAP Calculator

Let's calculate how many SAP Cans a wallet is entitled to based on
what it's holding, shall we?

You need an Alchemy key to talk to the blockchain, and then pass in
a wallet address to examine.

# Install

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

# .wallet File

You need an Alchemy key to talk to Ethereum, so your `~/.wallet` file
must look like:

```json
{
    "mainnet_alchemy_key": "<ALCHEMY-KEY-HERE>"
}
```

(This is read-only, so it doesn't need a private key.)

# Usage

```bash
node src/index.js <ADDRESS>
```
